# Checkout and Initiative Management Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Context Menu Not Showing Checkin/Cancel Checkout Options
**Problem**: When an application is checked out (showing DRAFT badge and Checked Out status), the context menu only shows "Edit" option instead of showing "Checkin" and "Cancel Checkout" options.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced logging in `isApplicationLocked()` function to debug lock detection
- Added detailed console logs to show lock details when found
- Added refetch of locks when initiative changes

### 2. Initiative Cancellation Not Removing Locks
**Problem**: When an initiative is cancelled or completed, the checkouts (locks) should be removed but some were persisting.

**Fixes Applied**:

#### A. Cancel Initiative Already Working
The cancel endpoint already removes locks:
```typescript
// Line 1048 in initiatives.ts
await db.delete(artifactLocks)
  .where(eq(artifactLocks.initiativeId, id));
```

#### B. Complete/Baseline Initiative Fix
Added lock removal to the baseline endpoint:
```typescript
// Added before updating initiative status to completed
await db.delete(artifactLocks)
  .where(eq(artifactLocks.initiativeId, id));
```

### 3. Enhanced Lock Detection and Refresh
- Added automatic refetch of locks when initiative changes
- Enhanced logging to show exactly what lock data is being returned
- Added more detailed console logging for debugging

## Debug Steps

1. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Look for "isApplicationLocked" messages
   - Check "Context menu for [app name]" logs
   - Verify lock data structure

2. **After Checkout**:
   - Should see: "Lock created: [lock object]" in server logs
   - Should see: "isApplicationLocked([id]): Found lock" in client logs

3. **After Initiative Cancel/Complete**:
   - Locks should be automatically removed
   - Applications should return to normal state

## Expected Behavior

### During Checkout
1. Application row turns amber/orange
2. "DRAFT" badge appears
3. Status shows "Checked Out"
4. Context menu shows:
   - Edit
   - Checkin
   - Cancel Checkout

### After Initiative Cancel/Complete
1. All locks for that initiative are removed
2. All checked out items return to normal state
3. Draft badges disappear
4. Context menu returns to showing only "Checkout"

## Testing Steps

1. **Test Checkout and Context Menu**:
   - Select an initiative
   - Checkout an application
   - Right-click and verify menu shows Checkin/Cancel options
   - Check console for lock detection logs

2. **Test Initiative Cancellation**:
   - Checkout multiple items in an initiative
   - Cancel the initiative
   - Verify all checkouts are cleared
   - Verify visual indicators return to normal

3. **Test Initiative Completion**:
   - Checkout items in an initiative
   - Complete/baseline the initiative
   - Verify all locks are removed

## Current Status

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ **Visual indicators working**: Applications show amber/orange background and DRAFT badge when checked out
2. ✅ **Initiative cancellation removes locks**: Cancel endpoint properly deletes all locks for the initiative
3. ✅ **Initiative completion removes locks**: Baseline endpoint properly deletes all locks for the initiative
4. ✅ **Enhanced logging**: Added detailed console logging for lock detection debugging

### Fixed Issues (Latest):
5. ✅ **Checkout logic error**: Fixed version control service that was incorrectly blocking checkout when user already had a lock on the same artifact in the same initiative
   - **Root Cause**: The checkout logic was throwing an error whenever ANY lock existed, even if it was the same user's lock in the same initiative
   - **Fix**: Modified the lock check to allow checkout if the existing lock is by the same user in the same initiative
   - **File**: `/server/services/version-control.service.ts` lines 188-197

### Remaining Issue:
- ❌ **Context menu not showing Checkin/Cancel options**: Despite locks being detected (visual indicators work), the context menu logic isn't properly detecting locked state

### Debug Information:
From the screenshot, we can see:
- Application "test-5k-002" shows amber background and DRAFT badge (visual indicators working)
- Right-click context menu only shows basic options (Edit, View Details, etc.)
- Missing expected options: Checkin, Cancel Checkout

### Next Steps for Manual Testing:
1. **Check browser console logs** for:
   - "isApplicationLocked" messages
   - "Context menu for [app name]" logs
   - Lock data structure details

2. **Verify lock data consistency**:
   - Ensure locks API returns proper data structure
   - Check if lock.lock.lockedBy matches currentUser.id
   - Verify timing of lock data vs context menu rendering

## Implementation Notes

- Locks are stored with initiative ID
- Lock removal is done in database transaction
- Visual indicators depend on lock presence
- Context menu options are determined by lock ownership
