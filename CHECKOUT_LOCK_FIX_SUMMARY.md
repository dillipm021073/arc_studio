# Checkout Lock Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Expired Locks Not Being Cleaned Up
- **Problem**: Expired locks remained in the database, preventing proper checkout state visibility
- **Solution**: 
  - Added automatic lock cleanup service that runs every hour
  - Added cleanup of expired locks before creating new ones
  - Created maintenance scripts to clean existing expired locks

### 2. Missing Locks for Existing Versions
- **Problem**: When an artifact already had a version in an initiative but no lock (due to expiry or deletion), the checkout would return the existing version without creating a new lock
- **Solution**: Modified `checkoutArtifact` to check for and create missing locks when returning existing versions

## Code Changes

### 1. Lock Cleanup Service (`server/services/lock-cleanup.service.ts`)
- Automatically removes expired locks every hour
- Removes locks from completed/cancelled initiatives
- Provides manual cleanup capability

### 2. Version Control Service (`server/services/version-control.service.ts`)
- Added cleanup of expired locks before checkout
- Added lock creation for existing versions without locks
- Enhanced error logging for lock creation failures

### 3. Server Startup (`server/index.ts`)
- Starts lock cleanup service on server start
- Graceful shutdown of cleanup service

## How Checkout Now Works

1. **User clicks checkout**
2. **System checks for existing version** in the initiative
   - If found WITH valid lock → Returns existing version
   - If found WITHOUT valid lock → Creates new lock and returns version
   - If not found → Creates new version and lock
3. **Lock is created** with 24-hour expiry
4. **Lock cleanup service** runs hourly to remove expired locks

## Testing Scripts Created

- `scripts/check-checkout-state.ts` - Checks current lock state
- `scripts/fix-checkout-persistence.ts` - Fixes existing lock issues
- `scripts/test-lock-creation.ts` - Tests manual lock creation
- `scripts/debug-locks-issue.ts` - Debugs lock problems
- `scripts/monitor-checkouts.ts` - Real-time checkout monitoring

## Result

✅ Checkouts now properly show as locked in the UI
✅ Expired locks are automatically cleaned up
✅ System recovers gracefully from missing locks
✅ Proper checkout state is maintained until initiative closure
