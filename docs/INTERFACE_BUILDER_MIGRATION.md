# Interface Builder JSONB Migration Guide

## Overview
This migration converts the Interface Builder's storage from TEXT to JSONB, allowing storage of larger data including base64-encoded images.

## Why This Migration?
- **Problem**: 80KB PNG images couldn't be stored due to TEXT field limitations
- **Solution**: JSONB has no practical size limits and better performance
- **Benefits**: 
  - Store images up to 50MB+
  - Better query performance
  - Native JSON operations
  - Automatic compression

## Running the Migration

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure your `.env` file has the correct `DATABASE_URL`
2. Back up your database (important!)

### Execute Migration
```bash
npm run db:migrate:jsonb
```

### What the Migration Does
1. Checks current column types
2. Converts `nodes`, `edges`, and `metadata` columns from TEXT to JSONB
3. Creates GIN indexes for performance
4. Creates an optional `interface_builder_assets` table for future binary storage
5. Verifies the migration was successful

### Sample Output
```
ðŸ”„ Starting migration to JSONB for interface_builder_projects...
ðŸ“‹ Current column types:
  - nodes: text
  - edges: text
  - metadata: text
ðŸ”§ Converting nodes column to JSONB...
ðŸ”§ Converting edges column to JSONB...
ðŸ”§ Converting metadata column to JSONB...
ðŸ“Š Creating GIN indexes for better JSONB performance...
âœ… Migration completed successfully!

ðŸ“‹ New column types:
  - nodes: jsonb
  - edges: jsonb
  - metadata: jsonb

ðŸ“Š Total projects in database: 15
ðŸ”§ Creating interface_builder_assets table for future binary storage...
âœ… Assets table created successfully!
âœ… Database connection closed
ðŸŽ‰ Migration completed successfully!
```

## Rollback
If something goes wrong, the migration automatically rolls back. To manually revert:

```sql
-- Revert to TEXT (not recommended)
ALTER TABLE interface_builder_projects 
  ALTER COLUMN nodes TYPE TEXT USING nodes::TEXT,
  ALTER COLUMN edges TYPE TEXT USING edges::TEXT,
  ALTER COLUMN metadata TYPE TEXT USING metadata::TEXT;

-- Drop indexes
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_interface_builder_projects_nodes;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_interface_builder_projects_edges;
```

## Verification
After migration, test by:
1. Creating a new interface with an image
2. Loading existing interfaces
3. Saving and updating interfaces

## Notes
- The migration is safe and preserves all existing data
- It's backward compatible - no code changes needed
- The API routes have been updated to work with JSONB natively
