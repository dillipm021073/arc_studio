# SID UML Hierarchy Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of proper SID UML hierarchy for business process diagrams in the Application Interface Tracker. The implementation ensures that business processes at all levels (A, B, and C) are properly visualized with their correct structural relationships.

## Problem Statement

The original SID UML implementation had several issues:
1. Level A process swim lanes were overlapping due to incorrect positioning
2. Level C process interfaces (IMLs) were not appearing in the diagram
3. Level B processes were not displaying as swim lanes
4. Level C processes were not appearing as blue boxes inside Level B swim lanes
5. IMLs and internal activities were not properly contained within their respective Level C processes

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Fixed Level A Swim Lane Positioning

**Issue**: Level A start and end swim lanes were overlapping because the end lane was positioned before child processes were calculated.

**Solution**: 
- Moved Level A end lane calculation to occur **after** all child processes are positioned
- Enhanced positioning logic to account for all child process heights
- Ensured proper spacing between Level A content and child processes

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Calculate the final end position considering all content
const hasDirectItems = directInterfaces.length + internalActivities.length > 0;
const directItemsEndY = hasDirectItems 
  ? initialYOffset + (directInterfaces.length + internalActivities.length) * ySpacing
  : initialYOffset;

// Find the maximum Y position from all process groups
let maxChildProcessY = directItemsEndY;
processGroupPositions.forEach((position) => {
  const childEndY = position.y + position.height;
  if (childEndY > maxChildProcessY) {
    maxChildProcessY = childEndY;
  }
});

// Use the maximum Y position plus padding
const levelAEndY = Math.max(directItemsEndY, maxChildProcessY) + 100;
```

### 2. Fixed Level C Interface Loading

**Issue**: Level C process interfaces were not being fetched due to a dependency cycle and hardcoded empty arrays.

**Solution**:
- Resolved circular dependency between `allChildInterfaces` and `grandchildProcesses` queries
- Created separate `grandchildInterfaces` query for Level C process interfaces
- Updated interface combination logic to include all interface types

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Separate query for grandchild interfaces
const { data: grandchildInterfaces = [], isLoading: grandchildInterfacesLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["grandchild-process-interfaces", grandchildProcesses],
  queryFn: async () => {
    if (grandchildProcesses.length === 0) return [];
    
    const allInterfaces = await Promise.all(
      grandchildProcesses.map(async (grandchildProcess: any) => {
        const response = await fetch(`/api/business-processes/${grandchildProcess.id}/interfaces`);
        if (!response.ok) return [];
        const interfaces = await response.json();
        return interfaces.map((iface: any) => ({
          ...iface,
          businessProcessId: grandchildProcess.id,
          businessProcessName: grandchildProcess.businessProcess,
          businessProcessLevel: grandchildProcess.level
        }));
      })
    );
    
    return allInterfaces.flat();
  },
  enabled: grandchildProcesses.length > 0 && businessProcess?.level === 'A',
});

// Fixed interface mapping for Level C processes
const grandchildProcessInterfaces = grandchildInterfaces.filter(
  (iface: any) => iface.businessProcessId === grandchild.id
).map((iface: any, index: number) => ({
  id: iface.id,
  imlNumber: iface.imlNumber,
  interfaceType: iface.interfaceType,
  providerApp: iface.providerApp,
  consumerApp: iface.consumerApp,
  sequenceNumber: iface.sequenceNumber || index + 1,
}));
```

### 3. Implemented Proper SID UML Hierarchy

**Issue**: The SID UML structure was not displaying the proper hierarchy with Level B swim lanes and Level C blue boxes.

**Solution**:
- Modified SID UML generator to create swim lanes for Level B processes
- Added blue process group boxes for Level C processes
- Ensured IMLs and internal activities are contained within appropriate Level C boxes

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Create process group boxes for Level C processes inside Level B
if (process.level === 'C' && isNested) {
  const laneWidth = applications.length * lifelineSpacing + 100;
  
  // Create blue process group box for Level C
  nodes.push({
    id: `process-group-${process.id}`,
    type: 'processGroup',
    position: { x: 50, y: localY - 30 },
    data: {
      businessProcess: process,
      childInterfaces: process.interfaces || [],
      parentProcesses: []
    },
    draggable: true,
    selectable: true,
    style: {
      width: laneWidth - 100,
      height: processHeight + 40,
      zIndex: -5 // Process boxes in background
    }
  });
}

// Create process lanes for Level A and Level B processes
// Level B processes always get swim lanes, even if they only contain child processes
if (process.level === 'A' || (process.level === 'B' && (processItems.length > 0 || process.childProcesses?.length > 0))) {
  const laneWidth = applications.length * lifelineSpacing + 100;
  
  // Start lane
  nodes.push({
    id: `lane-start-${process.id}`,
    type: 'processLane',
    position: { x: 0, y: localY - 50 },
    data: {
      type: 'start',
      processName: process.businessProcess,
      processLevel: process.level,
      description: process.description || `Level ${process.level} process`
    },
    // ... additional properties
  });
  
  // End lane
  nodes.push({
    id: `lane-end-${process.id}`,
    type: 'processLane',
    position: { x: 0, y: localY + processHeight - 10 },
    data: {
      type: 'end',
      processName: process.businessProcess,
      processLevel: process.level,
      description: process.description
    },
    // ... additional properties
  });
}
```

## Final SID UML Structure

The implemented structure follows this hierarchy:

```
Level A Process (Main Swim Lane)
├── Start Marker
├── Direct Level A Interfaces (if any)
├── Direct Level A Internal Activities (if any)
├── Level B Process 1 (Swim Lane)
│   ├── Start Marker
│   ├── Direct Level B Interfaces (if any)
│   ├── Direct Level B Internal Activities (if any)
│   ├── Level C Process 1.1 (Blue Process Group Box)
│   │   ├── IMLs for Process 1.1
│   │   └── Internal Activities for Process 1.1
│   ├── Level C Process 1.2 (Blue Process Group Box)
│   │   ├── IMLs for Process 1.2
│   │   └── Internal Activities for Process 1.2
│   └── End Marker
├── Level B Process 2 (Swim Lane)
│   ├── Start Marker
│   ├── Level C Process 2.1 (Blue Process Group Box)
│   │   ├── IMLs for Process 2.1
│   │   └── Internal Activities for Process 2.1
│   └── End Marker
└── End Marker
```
