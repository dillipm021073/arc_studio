# Visual Indicators Not Showing - Fix Applied

## Issue
Even though checkout was successful, the visual indicators (color coding) were not showing in the applications list.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `applications.tsx` file where the lock ownership comparison was incorrect:

1. In the context menu (line 950):
   ```typescript
   // INCORRECT:
   const isLockedByMe = lock?.lock.lockedBy === lock?.user?.id;
   
   // CORRECT:
   const isLockedByMe = lock?.lock.lockedBy === currentUser?.id;
   ```

2. In the edit complete handler (line 1118):
   ```typescript
   // INCORRECT:
   if (lock?.lock.lockedBy === lock?.user?.id) {
   
   // CORRECT:
   if (lock?.lock.lockedBy === currentUser?.id) {
   ```

The code was comparing `lock.lock.lockedBy` with `lock.user.id` instead of with the current user's ID (`currentUser?.id`).

## Fix Applied
Updated both occurrences to correctly compare the lock's `lockedBy` field with the current user's ID.

## Debug Logging Added
Added console logging to help diagnose issues:
1. Log the locks data structure when loaded
2. Log detailed lock status for each application that has a lock

## Expected Behavior After Fix
When an application is checked out:
- The row should show with amber/yellow background color
- A "DRAFT" badge should appear
- The checkout status should be visible in the Version Status column
- The context menu should show appropriate options (Edit, Checkin, Cancel Checkout)

## Testing Steps
1. Select an initiative (not production view)
2. Checkout an application
3. Verify the visual indicators appear:
   - Amber/yellow row background
   - "DRAFT" badge
   - Lock icon
   - Correct context menu options
4. Check browser console for debug logs to verify lock detection is working correctly
