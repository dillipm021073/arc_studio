# Visual Indicators Complete Fix - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Visual Indicators Not Showing After Checkout
**Problem**: Even though checkout was successful, the row color and visual indicators were not appearing.

**Root Causes**:
1. Incorrect lock ownership comparison in multiple places
2. Query invalidation key mismatch
3. Locks data not refreshing properly after checkout

**Fixes Applied**:

#### A. Fixed Lock Ownership Comparison
```typescript
// BEFORE (Incorrect):
const isLockedByMe = lock?.lock.lockedBy === lock?.user?.id;

// AFTER (Correct):
const isLockedByMe = lock?.lock.lockedBy === currentUser?.id;
```
Fixed in two locations:
- Context menu logic (line 963)
- Edit complete handler (line 1118)

#### B. Fixed Query Invalidation Keys
```typescript
// BEFORE (Incorrect):
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['version-control-locks'] });

// AFTER (Correct):
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['version-control-locks', currentInitiative?.initiativeId] });
```
The query key must match exactly, including the initiativeId parameter.

#### C. Enhanced Lock Data Refresh
- Added `refetch` function from useQuery
- Set `staleTime: 0` and `cacheTime: 0` to force fresh data
- Added explicit `refetchLocks()` calls after mutations
- Added `refreshKey` state to force component re-render

### 2. Context Menu Showing Wrong Options
**Problem**: After checkout, the context menu should show Edit/Checkin/Cancel options, not Checkout again.

**Fix**: The logic was already correct, but the locks data wasn't updating. The fixes above ensure the locks data refreshes properly, which makes the context menu show the correct options.

## Debug Logging Added
Added comprehensive logging to help diagnose issues:
```typescript
// Logs the entire locks data structure
console.log('Locks data structure:', locks);

// Logs current user ID for comparison
console.log('Current user ID:', currentUser?.id);

// Logs each lock detail
locks.forEach((lock: any) => {
  console.log(`Lock for ${lock.lock.artifactType} ${lock.lock.artifactId}:`, {
    lockedBy: lock.lock.lockedBy,
    username: lock.user?.username,
    userId: lock.user?.id
  });
});
```

## Expected Behavior
1. **Before Checkout**:
   - Default row styling (no background color)
   - Context menu shows "Checkout" option
   - No badges or indicators

2. **After Checkout**:
   - Amber/yellow row background (`bg-amber-950/30`)
   - Left border in amber color
   - "DRAFT" badge next to application name
   - Status column shows "Checked Out" with amber styling
   - Context menu shows:
     - Edit
     - Checkin
     - Cancel Checkout (in red)

3. **Visual State Mapping**:
   - **Checked Out by Me**: Amber/yellow background, "DRAFT" badge
   - **Locked by Others**: Red background, "LOCKED" badge
   - **Has Initiative Changes**: Blue background, "MODIFIED" badge
   - **Production**: Default styling

## Testing Steps
1. Open browser console to see debug logs
2. Select an initiative (not production view)
3. Right-click an application and select "Checkout"
4. Verify:
   - Success toast appears
   - Row changes to amber/yellow background
   - "DRAFT" badge appears
   - Console shows lock data with correct user ID
5. Right-click the same application again
6. Verify context menu shows:
   - Edit
   - Checkin
   - Cancel Checkout
   - NO "Checkout" option
