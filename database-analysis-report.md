### ✅ Additional Features

1. **Capability Management**
   - application_capabilities: 369 rows
   - capabilities: 0 rows
   - capability_extraction_history: 20 rows
   - uploaded_documents: 2 rows

2. **Communication System**
   - conversations: 1 row
   - Other communication tables ready but empty

3. **Business Process Hierarchy**
   - business_process_hierarchy_designs: 2 rows

## Data Population Status

### Well Populated:
- Applications (13)
- Interfaces (12) 
- Business Processes (69 with hierarchy)
- Application Capabilities (369)
- RBAC system (roles, permissions, mappings)
- User Activity Logging (18k+ entries)

### Empty/Minimal Data:
- Change Requests (0)
- Version Control system (0)
- IML Diagrams (0)
- Most communication tables (minimal)

## Recommendations

1. **Version Control Initialization**: 
   - The version control tables exist but have no baseline versions
   - Consider running the baseline creation script from `add_version_control_tables.sql`

2. **Test Data**: 
   - Change Request system has no test data
   - Version control system needs initialization
   - Communication system could use more test conversations

3. **Active Usage**:
   - High activity in user_activity_log (18k+ entries) shows active system use
   - Good number of application capabilities extracted (369)
   - Business process hierarchy well-defined (69 processes, 66 relationships)

## Conclusion

The database is properly set up with all required tables according to CLAUDE.md requirements. The schema supports:
- ✅ Application and Interface management (AML/IML)
- ✅ Business Process management with hierarchy
- ✅ Change Request tracking
- ✅ Version Control and Initiative management
- ✅ RBAC with comprehensive permissions
- ✅ Interface Builder with diagram storage
- ✅ Communication/collaboration features
- ✅ TMF domain integration
- ✅ Capability extraction and management

The system appears to be in active use with substantial data in core tables and comprehensive activity logging.
